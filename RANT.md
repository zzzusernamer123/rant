this conversation/rant i had with my best friend since 7th grade does, in my opinion, a great job of encapulating my thoughts, feelings, and emotions in regards to the legal immigration process my wife, son and I have been going through. If you care about me, please feel free to give this a read. Warning, this was a private conversation between my best friend and I and I do use some strong language to help express my views and feelings.
