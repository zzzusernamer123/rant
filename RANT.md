dude that shit helps you
yea bro how is that shit coming along?

fireballofdoom — Today at 11:34 PM
i mean no word really
it says they've been actively reviewing our case since february
which sounds typical from what ive heard and researched actually
shit just moves slow at USCIS

MinM1003 — Today at 11:35 PM
how long does it typically take

fireballofdoom — Today at 11:35 PM
its hard to give you a good answer for that
covid and all this shit isnt typical lol
immigrants flooding the border isnt typical
afghan immigrants being flown here and released as refugees isnt typical
these past few years have not been typical
immigration slowed down under a trump presidency compared to obama and its actually gotten worse for people trying to immigrate legally under biden 

MinM1003 — Today at 11:38 PM
damn dude well atleast you are doing it the right way
can she visit you up there

fireballofdoom — Today at 11:39 PM
no

MinM1003 — Today at 11:39 PM
damn

fireballofdoom — Today at 11:39 PM
because the usa is RETARDED
fucking straight up retarded
if she was from canada or many other countries, she could get a visa waiver for being married to a us citizen

MinM1003 — Today at 11:39 PM
yea very true

fireballofdoom — Today at 11:39 PM
but because shes from mexico she cant come
because mexico, our fucking neighbor
isnt apart of that program
its fucking STUPID
and it is pisses me off

MinM1003 — Today at 11:39 PM
but like even with a pass port still no?

fireballofdoom — Today at 11:39 PM
yes
even with a passport
MinM1003 — Today at 11:39 PM
damn

fireballofdoom — Today at 11:40 PM
eddie and mary both have valid passports
the issue is getting a visa
the wait time for a tourist visa INTERVIEW
INTERVIEW, not issuance
is
over 500 days
fucking
RETARDED
like what the fuck
and they wont let her get a waiver for the visa because we treat our neighbors to the south like shit
and because we treat them like shit, no wonder they want to fucking come here
i have so much more sympathy for the people that want to come to the states for the opportunties
i would want to do the same if i lived in mexico and was born there
many people live in actual fucking poverty in mexico
compared to the bullshit people call poverty here in the states
i hate the government
i hate our government, i hate all governments, i hate taxes, i hate them printing all this fucking money and ruining our country
the world could be a much better place but theres 2 types of people that run this world and destroy it for the rest of us
you got assholes who want to take a cut of everything, in every industry and every step of the way
and then you got fucking narcissists
/endrant

MinM1003 — Today at 11:45 PM
yea dude it fucking sucks
but hopefully theyll get it figured out and she can come with you

fireballofdoom — Today at 11:46 PM
if they cant figure it out, ill fucking figure it out for them
we are going to live together no matter what
i will sneak her into MY fucking country if i have to
these assholes have no right to prevent me and my wife from living together
i dont care what any bs reason anyone says or tells me. its not right and i don't care for their excuses
how would you or anyone feel if the government had to verify your relationship with your partner is real or not?
because thats whats happening to me and millions of other US citizens
its not fucking right.
and no one gives a FUCK about us.

MinM1003 — Today at 11:49 PM
well i mena shes your wife so they have no righht to do that

fireballofdoom — Today at 11:49 PM
i know you and my close friends and family do
but still
FUCK EM
people always give us the excuse, "blah blah blah national security"
i dont give a shit, you figure it out. its not my problem
i didn't cause them.
i won't fix them.
and i really don't care.
